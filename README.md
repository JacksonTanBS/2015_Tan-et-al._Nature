This repository provides supporting information for the paper <i>Recent increases in tropical rainfall driven by changes in frequency of organised deep convection</i> by Jackson Tan, Christian Jakob, William B. Rossow and George Tselioudis.

It contains the final version of the codes used in the analysis of the data (under folder `codes`) and production of the diagrams (under folder `images`). Supporting data required to execute the codes are also provided (under folder `Data/trend`). However, the raw data used in this study is not provided and have to be downloaded separately; however, some of the codes provided may be of assistance for this step. To successfully run the codes, you may need to modify some variables such as the directories.

These codes have been tested with Python 3.3.2 on CentOS 6.6. The required Python modules and their versions can be found in `codes/requirements.txt`. See `codes/README.txt` for more information on the codes.
